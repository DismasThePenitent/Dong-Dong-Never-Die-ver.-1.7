- denied spectators should get correct error message now

r28:
- fixed some compiler warnings
- actually, spectator mode still didn't work, more fixes
- no more invalid iterators during spectator cleanup (possible crash)
- another fix to delay calculation

- re-enable -O2

r26:
- another general fix

r25:
- possible fix for general brokenness
- fix for spectator mode
- more debug log information
- "activate" host's lunaport window on connection

r24:
- option for input rate display in lunaport.ini (DisplayInputrate)
- option for FPS display in lunaport.ini (DisplayFramerate)
- add FPS and input per second display to title bar

r23:
- remove temporary measurement code

r22:
- add more debug log information for spectator mode
- readjust delay calculation once more
- use measurements
- added temporary measurement code for inputs/second
- tweak network constants, bump protocol version

r21:
- fix to spectator mode

r20:
- readjust delay calculation (seems better for now)

r19:
- fix replay recording of single player mode in network game
- hopefully improved netcode

r18:
- lots of testing

r17:
- another change for that part, maybe it's better now

r16:
- fix for netcode bug introduced in r13

r15:
- add setting for number of stages to lunaport.ini
- allow host to specify delay
- smarter user input code

r14:
- allow configuration of port in lunaport.ini
- add support for configuration file

r13:
- lame, experimental lag spike compensation
- increase initial spectator buffer

r12:
- quick fix for spectator mode, still experimental
- enable -O2 for compilation

r11:
- experimental spectator support
- improved handshake should eliminate "invalid handshake sequence" on client side due to out-of-order packets
- bring game window to foreground
- minor code cleanups

r10:
- support single player mode for replay recording and network

r9:
- replay recording and playback added

r8:

r5:
- hopefully improved netcode

r4:
- redesign input hooks
- much more logging, debug output to log
